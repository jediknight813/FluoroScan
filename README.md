# FluoroScan

A very simple implementation of disease cell detection using YOLO8, I was inspired after interviewing with Brightest Bio to put this together as a proof of concept.

Using a dataset of 1200 images created using a python script and trained on a rtx 4070 for a half hour I created a small test model, along with a gradio interface for easy testing of the model.
